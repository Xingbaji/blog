title: "Deep Euler method: solving ODEs by approximating the local truncation error of the Euler method"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/DeepEuler
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method, deep Euler method (DEM) to solve
ordinary differential equations. DEM significantly improves the accuracy of the Euler method
by approximating the local truncation error with deep neural networks which could obtain a high
precision solution with a large step size. The deep neural network in DEM is mesh-free during
training and shows good generalization in unmeasured regions. DEM could be easily combined
with other schemes of numerical methods, such as Runge-Kutta method to obtain better solutions.
Furthermore, the error bound and stability of DEM is discussed.'
